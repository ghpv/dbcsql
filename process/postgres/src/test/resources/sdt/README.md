# Sample data

This is a collection of examples for `dbcsql` application.

Contents:

- `context.sql`: sample database for operations to run in (not formatted, but you can just execute it on postgres DB).
- `context.dsl`: sample context for operations describing `context.sql` (note: this is not a full mapping, just enough to get the contracts to work)
- Files starting with `00` through `08`: sample operations (contracts)
